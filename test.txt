Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1.
Stars shine because they are transmuting vast amounts of hydrogen into helium. Our sun alone consumes six hundred million tons of hydrogen per second, converting it into five hundred and ninety-six million tons of helium. Think about it: Six hundred million tons per second. Even at night.
And where does the other four million tons per second go? It's converted into energy according to Einstein's famous formula, E=mc2. About three-and-a-half-pounds-per-second's worth finds its way to the earth, where it forms the light of the dawn rising, the warmth of a summer afternoon, and the red glow of a dying day.
The sun's ferocious consumption of hydrogen sustains us all, but hydrogen's importance to life as we know it begins closer to home. Together with oxygen it forms the clouds, oceans, lakes, and rivers. Combined with carbon (6), nitrogen (7), and oxygen (8), it bonds together the blood and body of all living things.
Hydrogen is the lightest of all the gases -- lighter even than helium -- and much cheaper, which accounts for its ill-advised use in early airships such as the Hindenburg. You may have heard how well that went, though in fairness the people died because they fell, not because they were burned by the hydrogen, which in some ways is less dangerous to have in a vehicle than, say, gasoline.
Hydrogen is the most abundant element, the lightest, and the most beloved by physicists because, with only one proton and one electron, their lovely quantum mechanical formulas actually work on it. Once you get to helium with two protons and two electrons, the physicists pretty much throw up their hands and let the chemists have it.

Helium has an atomic number of 2.
Helium is named for the Greek god of the sun, Helios, because the first hints of its existence were dark lines in the spectrum of sunlight that could not be explained by the presence of any elements known at the time.
It might seem a paradox that an element common enough to fill party balloons with was the first element to be discovered in space. The reason is that helium is one of the noble gases, so named because they do not interact with the common riffraff of elements, remaining inert and aloof to nearly all chemical bonding. Because it does not interact, helium could not easily be detected by conventional chemical methods.
As a replacement for hydrogen in airships, helium, which is completely nonflammable, has much to recommend it. The main problem is that it's a lot more expensive, and provides somewhat less lift. Anyone want to go for a ride in the low bid model?
The helium we use today is extracted from natural gas as it comes out of the ground. But unlike all other stable elements, it was not deposited there when the earth was formed. Instead it was created over time by the radioactive decay of uranium (92) and thorium (90). These elements decay by alpha particle emission, and alpha particle is simply the physicist's name for the nucleus of a helium atom. So when you fill a party balloon, you're filling it with atoms that just a few tens or hundreds of millions of years ago were random protons and neutrons in the nuclei of large radioactive atoms. That, frankly, is weird. Though not as weird as the way lithium messes with your mind.

Lithium has an atomic number of 3.
Lithium is a very soft, very light metal. So light that it floats on water, a feat matched by only one other metal, sodium (11). While floating on water, lithium will react with that water, releasing hydrogen gas at a steady, moderate rate. (The real excitement in this department begins with sodium.)
Because of its reactive nature, lithium is rarely found in metallic form outside the laboratory or chemical plant. But in the form of the Li+ ion, lithium powers countless electronic devices, from pacemakers to cars, including the laptop on which I am typing this text. Lithium-ion batteries pack tremendous power into not much weight, in part because of lithium's low density. Lithium stearate is also used in the popular lithium grease found on cars, trucks, and mechanics.
People who pay attention to these things have noticed an interesting fact: There's only one place in the world with a really large amount of easily recoverable lithium. If electric cars based on lithium-ion batteries ever become very widespread, you might want to keep an eye on Bolivia.
The lithium ion has another trick up its sleeve: It keeps some people on an even emotional keel. For reasons that are only vaguely understood, a steady dose of lithium carbonate (which dissolves into lithium ions in the body) smoothes out the highs and lows of bipolar disorder. That a simple element could have such a subtle effect on the mind is testimony to how even a phenomenon as complex as human emotion is at the mercy of basic chemistry.
Lithium is soft, reactive, and helps keep things in balance. Beryllium is, well, let's just say different.

Radon has an atomic number of 86.
Radon is a heavy radioactive gas with a half-life of only 3.2 days, but there is quite a lot of it around because it is a principle element in the decay chains of both uranium (92) and thorium (90), both of which exist in large quantities, particularly in granite bedrock. (Granite buildings emit significant amounts of radiation. (Grand Central Station in New York is famously radioactive for this reason.)
Radon seeping up from the ground and collecting in the basements of buildings is of concern to many people. A whole industry exists to detect and mitigate radon. (Your friendly neighborhood radon-abatement service will install expensive underground air channels and fans to draw the radon out from underneath your house before it gets inside.)
Ironically, while some people are paying big bucks to get rid of radon, others gather in cave spas near uranium deposits to breathe the rich, radon-laden air, believing it to be healthy. This belief, more popular a hundred years ago than today, originated with the discovery that many hot springs are quite radioactive (the water in them is hot because it flows near hot rocks, which are hot because of uranium and thorium decay deep in the earth).
A hundred years ago, when radioactivity was first being investigated, no one had any reason to suspect it was dangerous. Everyone knew hot springs were healthy, but no one could really say why. When it was discovered that many famous hot springs are radioactive, the answer seemed obvious: It must be this great new radiation thing!
The result was a decades-long health fad for all things radioactive, which ended only after the spectacular death of a famous proponent, which you can read about under thorium.
If people back then had known about francium, I'm sure someone would have been selling francium foot warmers.
